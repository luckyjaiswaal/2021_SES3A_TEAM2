# SentimentAnalysis

The purpose of this project is to create a sentiment analyser that can calculate the sentiment of a specific stock on social media, which can be potentially used to make trading decisions. The main objective of this project is to have a dashboard displaying the sentiment trend of the stocks along with the stock’s actual trading prices.
